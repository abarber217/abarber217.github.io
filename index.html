<h1>Obesity</h1>
<it>
Note: This piece has more than tripled in length since my first draft, and it may have made more sense as individual posts, but I decided to keep it all together for the sake of trying to cover every facet of the topic at once. By all means, use the hyperlinked table of contents to go to any sections you deem more important. It is my sincere hope that anyone who has personally dealt with obesity or who is close to someone who has can find something of value in the section pertaining to individual strategies.

It’s hard to write something that hasn’t been said before and it is similarly difficult to make an argument that hasn’t been previously presented. Obesity sucks. It’s associated with a number of terrible outcomes. And despite all of this, it’s increasing in prevalence steadily.

I want to try and write something that achieves a few objectives. First, I want to write something that is relatively comprehensive. Ideally, I’d like someone to read this and say “Okay, I understand obesity and metabolic fitness much better than I did before.” Second, I’d like to try to motivate people to see these issues as significant cause areas, like we did COVID, AIDS, and polio. Obesity and poor cardiovascular health are not merely cosmetic concerns – they are responsible for trillions of dollars of deadweight losses [citation needed] and hundreds of millions of years of life lost [citation needed]. Lastly, I’d like to zoom in on the best strategies for tackling these problems at both a policy level and at an individual level. However, I strongly believe that we are better off not “waiting for Superman” when it comes to these issues, so I will try to recommend a host of potential solutions for those who are struggling, like I have, with obesity and poor metabolic fitness.

On the other hand, there are a couple things that I *don’t* want to do. First and foremost, I do not want to contribute to the stigma that exists around overweight and obesity. Shaming individuals who have excess weight has been particularly effective in reducing the scale of the problem and might actually make the problem worse [citation needed]. More importantly, even if this weren’t the case, it’s still immoral to demean an individual or a group afflicted with any medical condition, regardless of cause. One small caveat is that I do have serious concerns with the “fat acceptance” movement, which appears to push back on the idea that obesity is harmful to the obese individual. Second, I do not wish to wade into the discussion of what is causing our obesity epidemic. I have spent a great deal of time thinking about possible causes and have come to the realization that people much smarter than me haven’t gotten any closer to solving this puzzle in the last decade or so. It is almost certainly multifactorial in nature, but I don’t know how useful it is to speculate on the weight each contributing factor deserves. What I care about much more – and find much more pragmatic – is understanding the costs imposed by obesity (and other associated conditions) and the solutions that make sense given these costs and the existing research.
